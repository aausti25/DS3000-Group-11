## Project Objectives

1. Clean and preprocess the airline delay dataset.  
2. Explore the data using descriptive statistics and visualizations.  
3. Train multiple machine learning models to predict:  
   - Whether a flight will be delayed (classification)  
   - Delay duration (regression)  
4. Compare model performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, F1-score, R², RMSE, ROC-AUC).  
5. Interpret results to understand influential delay factors.
